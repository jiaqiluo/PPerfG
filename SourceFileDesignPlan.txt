### Variables
1. layers  - The order of items in the array
             will be used as the order in diagram from top to below.

2. tasks   - The order of items in the array
             will be used as the order in "Job Run Layer" from left to right.
    name (string)          : the name of the task
    runtime (int)          : the runtime
    collectionTool (string): the tool for collecting data

3. datasets - The list of all dataset in this diagram
    size (float)           : the size of the dataset
    type (string)          : the type of the dataset

4. events  - describes the lines(or called edges) in the diagram
    method      : r for read, w for write, rw for readwrite, m for move
    dataset     : the dataset involved in this event
    origin      : where the edge starts, it is the circle if the origin is
                  the same as the dataset
    destination : where the edge ends, it is the circle if the destination
                  is the same the dataset

### Colors

Layers' color will be in fixed order as the sample diagram shows.
Circles representing same type of data will have the same color. And the specific color can be set in the "globalVariables.py" file.
