	|- notes

### Variables
1. layers  - The order of items in the array
             will be used as the order in diagram from top to below.

2. tasks   - The order of items in the array
             will be used as the order in "Job Run Layer" from left to right.
    name (string)          : the name of the task
    runtime (int)          : the runtime
    collectionTool (string): the tool for collecting data

3. datasets - The list of all dataset in this diagram
    size (float)           : the size of the dataset
    type (string)          : the type of the dataset

4. events  - describes the lines(or called edges) in the diagram
    method      : r for read, w for write, rw for readwrite, m for move
    dataset     : the dataset involved in this event
    origin      : where the edge starts, it is the circle if the origin is
                  the same as the dataset
    destination : where the edge ends, it is the circle if the destination
                  is the same the dataset

### Colors

Layers' color will be fixed order as the sample diagram shows.
Circles for dataset will choose a different color with its layer to make it detectable.

## Future plan
1. add support for moving action

## Notes
1. the placed_layer start at 1
