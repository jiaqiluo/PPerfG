### Variables
layers  - The order of items in the array
          will be used as the order in diagram from top to below.

tasks   - The order of items in the array
          will be used as the order in "Job Run Layer" from left to right.
    name            - the name of the task      : string
    runtime         - the runtime               : int
    collectionTool  - the tool for collecting relevant date
                      about this task           : string

datasets - The list of all dataset in this diagram
    size            - the size of the dataset         : floating number
    type            - the type of the dataset         : String

events  - describes the lines(or called edges) in the diagram
    method          - r for read, w for write, rw for readwrite, m for move
    dataset         - the dataset involved in this event
    origin          - where the edge starts, it is the circle if the origin is
                      the same as the dataset
    destination     - where the edge ends, it is the circle if the destination
                      is the same the dataset

human               - the places to put a human icon in the Job Run Layer.



### Colors

Layers' color will be fixed order as the sample diagram shows.
Circles for dataset will choose a different color with its layer to make it detectable.
