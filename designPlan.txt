### Variables

layers -  The order of items in the array will be used as the order in diagram from top to below.

tasks - The order of items in the array will be used as the order in "Job Run Layer" from left to right.

dataset - The list of all dataset in this diagram, each dataset includes its size (mb), type, createdLayer, usedLayer, and accessMethod
    size         - the size of the dataset         : floating number
    type         - the type of the dataset         : String
    createdLayer - where the dataset is created    : String
    usedLayer    - where the dataset is used       : array of Strings
    accessMethod - how the dataset is accessed     : array of Strings or Empty
* More explanation for accessMethod: the accessMethod will be used to draw lines and directions. Its value will be one ore more layers or the name of other datasets. For example, if the createdLayer is "Storage", usedLayer is "Setup", and accessMethod is "Memory", then there will be
    - tow circles: one in Storage Layer and another in Memory Layer
    - two arrow lines: one from the circle in Storage Layer to the circle in Memory   Layer, one form the circle in Memory Layer to Setup.

human - the places to put a human icon in the Job Run Layer.

### Colors

Layers' color will be fixed order as the sample diagram shows.
Circles for dataset will choose a different color with its layer to make it detectable.
